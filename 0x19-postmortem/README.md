Incident Report
Incident Summary
On April 7, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM EDT, the file storage service experienced intermittent slowdowns and partial outages. This resulted in a 30% decrease in file upload and download speeds, affecting approximately 15% of users.

Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a disk I/O bottleneck on the storage server. An influx of large file uploads, combined with inefficient disk caching mechanisms, led to degraded performance and occasional service disruptions.

Timeline
10:00 AM: An engineer noticed increased latency in file uploads and initiated an investigation.
10:10 AM: Monitoring systems triggered alerts for elevated error rates and slow response times in the file storage service.
10:15 AM: Initial assumption was focused on network congestion due to recent infrastructure changes.
10:30 AM: Recognizing ongoing performance issues, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis.
10:45 AM: Load balancing configurations were examined as a potential cause, leading to a brief misdirection in troubleshooting efforts.
11:00 AM: Upon deeper analysis, disk I/O utilization was identified as the primary bottleneck causing service degradation.
11:30 AM: The incident was escalated to senior engineering leadership for resolution planning and approval.
12:00 PM: To alleviate the issue, temporary adjustments were made to prioritize critical file transactions while a permanent fix was devised.
1:00 PM: The issue was resolved by optimizing disk caching mechanisms and reallocating resources to improve I/O performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
The following measures have been implemented to address the issue and prevent future occurrences:

1. Enhanced Disk Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring of disk I/O utilization to proactively identify potential bottlenecks.
2. Performance Tuning: Conduct regular performance tuning sessions to optimize disk caching mechanisms and improve overall system efficiency.
3. Scalability Assessment: Evaluate the scalability of the file storage infrastructure to accommodate increasing user demands without sacrificing performance.
4. Incident Response Training: Conduct specialized training sessions to familiarize the team with identifying and resolving disk-related performance issues swiftly.
5. Documentation Update: Update documentation to include troubleshooting procedures for disk I/O bottlenecks and their resolutions.

Tasks to Address the Issue
To address the identified root cause and prevent similar incidents in the future, the following tasks will be completed:

- Implement real-time disk I/O monitoring and alerting.
- Conduct performance tuning on storage servers.
- Evaluate scalability options for the file storage infrastructure.
- Schedule incident response training sessions for the team.
- Update documentation with troubleshooting procedures for disk-related performance issues.
